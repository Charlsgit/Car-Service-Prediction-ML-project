# Car-Service-Prediction-ML-project
Machine Learning model to predict car service requirements using Random Forest.

## **Project Overview**

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to determine whether a car requires service based on multiple features. A **Random Forest Classifier** is used due to its high accuracy, ability to handle noisy data, and robustness.

The workflow includes:

* Data preprocessing
* Handling missing values
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection
* Model training & evaluation
* Visualizations

---

## **Features Used**

The dataset evaluates car health based on factors such as:

* **Oil Quality**
* **Engine Performance**
* **Mileage**
* **Tyre Wear**
* **HVAC Condition**
* **Service History**

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Scikit-Learn**
* **RandomForestClassifier**

---

## **Steps Performed**

### **1️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Removed missing or inconsistent entries
* Converted categorical data
* Normalized/Standardized values **if needed** (scaler = StandardScaler(),X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X))

### **2️ Exploratory Data Analysis**

* Distribution plots
* Heatmaps
* Feature correlation
* Outlier inspection (Random forest = anomaly scores method)

### **3️ Model Building**

Algorithm used:

```
RandomForestClassifier()
```

Advantages

* Handles large datasets
* Prevents overfitting
* Gives feature importance

### **4️ Model Evaluation**

Evaluated using:

* **Accuracy** (Overall correctness of the model)
* **Precision** (correctly predicts the positive class)
* **Recall** (actual positives classified correctly as positives)
* **F1-score** (Balance between precision & recall)
* **Confusion Matrix**

---

## **Results**

* The model shows strong performance in predicting cars that need service
* Feature importance analysis reveals which car components affect service probability most

---

## **What I Learned**

* Building and evaluating ML classification models
* Understanding real-world maintenance patterns
* Data preprocessing & visualization
* Using Random Forest effectively

---

## **Future Improvements**

* Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit
* Add more features (e.g., temperature, driving style)
* Train using more ML algorithms for comparison
* Convert to a REST API
